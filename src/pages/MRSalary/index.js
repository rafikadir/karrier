										The sales job is one of the toughest jobs. Generally in any sales job, you have to make new
										clients month after month in order to achieve your targets as your clients don’t give you
										sales every month. But in the pharmaceutical industry, once you convert a doctor for your
										brand, he keeps writing your product every month, so there is continuous business generation
										month after month. If you’re able to convert 10-15 doctors from your territory then you are
										able to achieve your target. For fresher medical representative jobs are better than any
										other sales jobs.
										<br />
										That doesn’t mean that pharma selling is an easy job, conversion of a doctor is not an easy
										task. The doctor is one of society's most respected & knowledgeable people, so for their
										conversion, the rep should possess a good personality, communication skills & scientific
										knowledge. Doctors like the person having sound knowledge about therapy & product, so the
										person having such abilities have more probability to convert them. If you’re a hard worker
										& want to learn & grow then this industry suits you well. The Pharma industry is a
										science/knowledge-driven industry, so if anyone seeking good career growth in pharma selling
										then he must acquire these skills in order to overcome cutthroat competition.
